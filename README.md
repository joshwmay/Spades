# Spades

This was the final project I submitted with my group in the Spring 2019 semester of Object Oriented Programming with Aric Bills.

Our intent was to recreate the card game Spades in a computer program. 

We coded in Python using Jupyter for initial testing, PyGame and PyQt5 for the GUI, and wrote multiple modules to encompass the cards,
rules, AI, and gameplay(it's admittedly imperfect).

It was the first time any of us had worked on a GUI and we exceded the expectations we initially set for ourselves.

We also likely exceded the necessary amount of code needed to do what we did, but it was a very positive learning experience.

I have not looked at any of this code in 4 months at this point, but I am cognizant of areas in which methods could have been expedited
with some elegance that is not present in our submission.

I hope you enjoy what we created, and can find some appreciation for what was only made possible through determination and effort from my 
group.

Thanks for having a look.
